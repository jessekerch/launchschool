// A distinct string is a string that is present only once in an array.

// Given an array of strings, arr, and an integer, k, return the kth distinct string present in arr. If there are fewer than k distinct strings, return an empty string "".

// Note that the result string is the one encountered earliest in the array.

// Example

distinctString(["d","b","c","b","c","a"], 2); // "a"
