/**
Problem
Write a program that takes one argumentâ€”the total number of switches
and returns an array of the lights that are on after n repetitions.

Example
lightsOn(5);        // [1, 4]

Data
Object with light number: true/false for on/off

Algo
Build an object "bank"
Iterate idx from 1 to switches (inclusive), iterate by 1
  add idx and true to bank object

Iterate "number" from 1 to switches (inclusive), iterate by 1
  if bank[number] is divisible by pass (1 on first pass)
    toggle bank number (if true, toggle to false, and vice versa)

make a "result" array
for (key, value) of bank, 
  add bank number to array if it's true

return result
