Contact Manager
by Jesse Kercheval, April 10, 2024

Problem:
Create an app for adding and organizing contacts
contacts should have a full name, email address, phone number, and tags
search function by text or tag

Use MVC: Model, View, Controller
app.js imports M,V,C, and instantiates new App() on DOMContentLoaded

CONTROLLER
(contains control logic: receives update from View then notifies model to "add contact")

MODEL
(defines data structure: updates app to reflect added contact)

VIEW
(defines display: user clicks add new contact)
